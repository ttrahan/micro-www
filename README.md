# micro-www demo application

This is the front-end of a simple 2-tier app to demonstrate deploying a [Docker]
(www.docker.com)-based application on [AWS Elastic Beanstalk]
(aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) using command line instructions in a Shippable
CI build. To see the full functionality of the app, use the same steps to deploy
the back-end of the app which is also on Aye0Aye called [micro-api](https://github.com/aye0aye/micro-api/tree/amazon-eb-cli).

When this sample repo is enabled in Shippable, the CI process performs the following:
* Uses Docker to build the CI environment from a Dockerfile, pulling the base
image from public Docker Hub repository "aye0aye/micro-image"
* Executes some basic CI tests
* Stores the test results and code coverage report
* Upon successful CI build:
  * Pushes the newly built Docker image to Docker Hub repository "aye0aye/micro-api"
  * Deploys the new image to an Elastic Beanstalk application

# Environment variables for application:
- API_URL: URL for micro-api. include the full URL with port.
- WWW_PORT: Optional.  Port used for app (default:80)
- LOG_LEVEL: Optional.  Specifies log level for Winston console (silly, debug, verbose, info, warn, error).
This microservice uses info and error messages only.
- SHUD_LOG_TO_FILE: Optional.  true or false, specifies whether to save logs to logs.log

# Environment variables required for deploying to Elastic Beanstalk
Before beginning, create a new application and environment in Elastic Beanstalk
using [the instructions available here](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/getting-started/).

In the shippable.yml, change the following values based on your EB application:
- AWS_EB_APPLICATION:_yourElasticBeanstalkApplicationName_
- AWS_EB_ENVIRONMENT=_yourElasticBeanstalkEnvironmentName_
- AWS_S3_BUCKET=_yourS3BucketName_
- AWS_S3_FOLDER=_yourS3FolderName_ to upload deployment config files
- AWS_REGION=_yourPreferredAwsRegion_
- REGISTRY_ACCOUNT=_yourDockerRegistryAccount_  
  * Note that this can be the account/registry URL for any valid Docker Registry
- ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER=shippable.$REGISTRY_ACCOUNT
  * No changes needed
- AWS_DEPLOY_JSON=Dockerrun.aws.json.$ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER.$AWS_EB_APPLICATION
  * No changes needed
- AWS_DOCKER_CONFIG=dockerconfig.$ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER.$AWS_EB_APPLICATION
  * No changes needed
- secure variable 1: use the Shippable project settings page to encrypt your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- secure variable 2: use the Shippable project settings page to encrypt your AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
